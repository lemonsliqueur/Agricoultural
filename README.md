This project started as a way to showcase my capabilities in data and analytics.It is also an attempt to completely waste my time by doing extra work on weekends. 

Here I am going to document everything I think you should know about this project. 

The first thing I am going to do is downloading the europeans' agricoltural data and then make a framework to simulate a datawarehouse and some events. 

0th Step: Downloading some data

The goal of the research is also to estimate and predict if an household in some given area could make its ends if they work in an agricultural context. 

Here are some sources of data: 
 - OECD 
 - EUROSTAT
 - ISTAT
 - FAO 
 - worldbank 
 - ourworldindata

Here there is another addictional source of context and data: https://www.talend.com/resources/big-data-agriculture/
